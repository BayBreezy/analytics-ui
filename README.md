## Modules Used

- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
- nuxt-icon
- @vueuse/nuxt
- nuxt-headlessui
- @morev/vue-transitions/nuxt
- @davestewart/nuxt-scrollbar

Chart JS has no nuxt module but it was used as well.

Shadcn UI was used for the styles. I am not reinveting the wheel here.

## Components

Check the components folder for the components used in this project. Since I am not switching pages, I used the [`app.vue`](/app.vue) file to render everything.

Yes, light and dark mode is in place. Thanks to VueUse
